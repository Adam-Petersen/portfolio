  %p Below is a list of some of the personal projects I've been working on. I develop these on my own time, but use the technologies I've learned through my degree and past work experience. I will also include Github links for each project in case you're interested in the source code.

      %a.title{href: projects_chess_path} React Chess
      %p.description This is an app I wrote to further my knowledge of React JS. It is currently a work in progress. Currently you can only do two person local play, but soon I plan to add functionality for two person online play and an one person v. AI mode. More information about the app can be found in the applications README on Github.
